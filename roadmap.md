VMware ↔ Hyper-V migration (VMDK ↔ VHDX via qemu-img)
VirtualBox ↔ Hyper-V migration (VDI ↔ VHDX via qemu-img)
All six migration paths: vmware↔vbox, vmware↔hyperv, vbox↔hyperv
Driver cleanup during migration (remove VMware Tools, VBox Guest Additions, inject correct drivers)
initramfs regeneration for Linux guests after migration
NIC renaming and fstab UUID updates
Boot mode preservation (BIOS vs UEFI)


v2.0.0 — JSON Output and Machine-Readable Interface

--json flag on every command
All commands return structured JSON when --json is set
Error responses in JSON format with error codes
Enables AI/automation consumers to parse rift output
rift --json list returns {"hypervisor": "workstation", "vms": [{"name": "...", "state": "running"}]}
rift --json overview returns aggregated JSON from all detected hypervisors


v2.1.0 — VM Creation from YAML

rift create --file topology.yml
YAML manifest format:

yaml  vms:
    - name: k3s-worker-1
      os: ubuntu-64
      cpu: 4
      ram: 8192
      disks:
        - size: 60GB
      network:
        - type: bridged
      cloud-init: userdata.yml

Creates VMs on the default hypervisor or specified with --hv
VMware: generates .vmx + creates disks with vmware-vdiskmanager
VirtualBox: VBoxManage createvm + modifyvm + storagectl + storageattach
Hyper-V: New-VM + Set-VM + New-VHD
Cloud-init support for unattended Linux install
Parallel creation when manifest has multiple VMs
rift plan --file topology.yml shows what would be created without executing
Post-creation bootstrap: auto-run bootstrap-utilities to create runner user


v2.2.0 — REST API (rift serve)

rift serve --port 8080 starts HTTP server on each node
Endpoints mirror CLI commands:

GET /api/list → list VMs
POST /api/start → start VM
POST /api/stop → stop VM
POST /api/exec → execute command in guest
GET /api/overview → local hypervisor overview
POST /api/create → create VM from JSON payload
POST /api/migrate → start migration
GET /api/snapshots → list snapshots


API token authentication from .env
JSON request/response format
Runs on Tailscale IP for secure mesh access
Each node exposes its local hypervisor
Enables rift overview --fabric to query all nodes over HTTP


v2.3.0 — Fabric Mode (Multi-Node Orchestration)

rift overview --fabric queries all known nodes over Tailscale
Node registry in .env or nodes.yml:

yaml  nodes:
    - name: omen
      address: 100.82.208.41:8080
      hypervisor: workstation
    - name: pavilion
      address: 100.89.48.127:8080
      hypervisor: vbox
    - name: ai
      address: 100.84.84.55:8080
      hypervisor: hyperv

rift fabric list shows all VMs across all nodes
rift fabric start <vm> finds which node owns the VM and starts it remotely
rift fabric migrate <vm> --from omen --to pavilion migrates between physical machines

Converts disk, SCPs to target node over Tailscale, creates VM on target


Cross-node network visualization: shows which VMs on different nodes share the same bridge/subnet


v2.4.0 — TUI Dashboard (Bubble Tea)

rift tui launches terminal UI
Dashboard view: all VMs across all nodes in a navigable list
Keyboard shortcuts: Enter to start/stop, S for snapshot, E for exec
Live status updates polling each node's API
Fabric view: visualize nodes and their VMs
Progress bars for migration and export within the TUI
Lip Gloss styling: colors for state (green running, red stopped), borders, layout
Runs over SSH for remote access: ssh user@omen rift tui
Restricted SSH mode: ForceCommand rift tui for locked-down access


v3.0.0 — Proxmox Backend

Full Hypervisor interface via Proxmox REST API (/api2/json/)
Authentication with API tokens
VM lifecycle: start, stop, suspend, reset
Snapshot management
VM creation with cloud-init templates and storage pools
LXC container support alongside VMs
Cluster awareness: multi-node Proxmox clusters
Live migration between Proxmox nodes
Storage pool management: local, ZFS, Ceph
Network management: bridges, VLANs, bonds
Install Proxmox on dedicated hardware (old laptop or Tank alternative)


v3.1.0 — Type 2 to Type 1 Migration

rift migrate <vm> --from vmware --to proxmox
Read VMX config, convert VMDK to QCOW2 via qemu-img
SCP disk to Proxmox over SSH/Tailscale
qm importdisk on Proxmox side via API
Create VM with matching specs via Proxmox API
VirtIO driver injection for Linux guests
Windows guests: inject VirtIO drivers before migration
rift migrate <vm> --from proxmox --to vmware for reverse path
All Type 2 ↔ Type 1 paths: vmware↔proxmox, vbox↔proxmox, hyperv↔proxmox


v3.2.0 — Cloud Migration

rift migrate <vm> --to aws

Convert disk to RAW format
Upload to S3
Call aws ec2 import-image
Poll until AMI is ready
Launch instance from imported AMI
Assign security group, elastic IP, key pair


rift migrate <instance> --from aws --to vmware

Create AMI from instance
Export to S3 as VMDK
Download and register in VMware


Cloud-init and driver normalization for cloud targets
Pre-migration checks: compatible disk format, boot mode, drivers


v3.3.0 — API Backends (Performance)

Replace CLI shelling (vmrun, VBoxManage) with direct API calls
VMware Workstation: vmrest REST API
VirtualBox: COM/XPCOM API via Go bindings
Hyper-V: WMI direct queries instead of PowerShell subprocess
Reduced overhead, faster operations, more granular control
API backends expose features CLI backends can't: custom security groups, fine-grained network rules, programmatic firewall management


v4.0.0 — Ansible and Terraform Integration

Ansible inventory plugin: rift dynamic inventory source

Returns all VMs across all hypervisors as Ansible hosts
Groups by hypervisor, folder, OS type


Ansible module: rift_vm for lifecycle management in playbooks
Terraform provider: terraform-provider-rift

rift_vm resource for VM creation
rift_snapshot resource
rift_network data source
State management via Terraform state file


Post-creation Ansible playbooks: auto-configure VMs after rift create


v4.1.0 — Network Lab Automation

Topology-aware deployments from YAML

yaml  topology:
    routers:
      - name: R1
        image: vyos
        interfaces:
          - network: transit
          - network: lan-a
    switches:
      - name: SW1
        interfaces:
          - network: lan-a
          - network: lan-b
    clients:
      - name: PC1
        network: lan-a
      - name: PC2
        network: lan-b

Virtual network creation across hypervisors
Cross-hypervisor networking: bridge VMware VM to VBox VM on same subnet
Predefined templates: multi-router topology, K8s cluster, AD domain, DMZ
Network validation: ping tests, route checks, port scans after deployment


v5.0.0 — Additional Cloud Providers

Azure: rift azure create, rift azure list, managed disks, NSG rules
GCP: rift gcp create, rift gcp list, firewall rules, persistent disks
Oracle Cloud: KVM-based, similar to Proxmox integration
Cloud migration paths: AWS↔Azure, AWS↔GCP, any cloud↔any hypervisor
Multi-cloud overview in rift overview
Cost estimation: rift plan --file topology.yml --estimate shows projected cloud costs


v5.1.0 — Additional Hypervisors

KVM/libvirt: virsh CLI or libvirt Go bindings
XCP-ng: XenAPI
oVirt/RHV: REST API
Each follows the same pattern: implement Hypervisor interface, register in factory


v6.0.0 — AI-Driven Orchestration

rift ai command group
Local LLM (Ollama on Tank) interprets natural language:

"Start my K3S cluster" → rift start --folder K3S
"Migrate the Ubuntu server to VirtualBox" → rift migrate H26-U-S --from vmware --to vbox
"Create 3 web servers on AWS" → rift aws create --ami <id> --name web --count 3


Model reads rift --help and command documentation as context
rift serve JSON API is the interface between model and tool
OpenClaw integration for agentic coding against the rift codebase
Safety: rift plan shows proposed actions before execution, user approves
